    <em>Rift</em> is an infrastructure-less networking stack for the Internet of Things

  <h3>Infrastructure-less</h3>
  <p>
  Today's notion of IoT seems to imply that every device should be tethered to a WiFi network or a 3G tower. In the Rift architecture, devices communicate over direct peer-to-peer connections. Routers, gateways, and data plans are <em>not</em> required.
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>Simple and generic</h3>
  <p>
  The Rift architecture uses simple network primitives as the foundations of its application interface. These primitives are used solely for abstracting more complex and fine-grained network semantics into a network "language". This allows future wire[d|less] technologies to be ported and plugged in to existing applications.
  </p>

  <h3>Portable</h3>
  <p>
  As is the nature of the IoT industry, Rift is intended to be run on a multitude of devices of different CPU architectures, power profiles, and in any environment.

  <h3>Good for humans, fair for businesses</h3>
  <p>
  The project itself aims to be inherently good for humans, and fair for businesses. We intend to keep it this way by keeping Rift implementations and designs open and community-driven. Furthermore, given the sensitive nature of IoT technologies, we aim to keep privacy concerns (data collection, user identities, behavior tracking, etc) at the forefront of the discussion.
