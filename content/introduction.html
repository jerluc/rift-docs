  <h3>What is Rift?</h3>
  <p>
    Rift is an infrastructure-less network stack, built specifically to solve the unique
    connectivity problems that arise in modern Internet of Things applications. It <em>does not</em>
    aim to replace the use of existing protocol stacks (such as IP) in general applications, but
    rather intends to supplement the evolving IoT ecosystem by providing simple and lightweight
    peer-to-peer connectivity that can be deployed without the need for infrastructure such as
    network routers, cellular towers, satellites, etc.

  <h3>Motivations</h3>
  <p>
    Today's Internet of Things devices all seem to share at least one thing in common: they require
    an Internet connection. This may come as no surprise considering the "I" in "IoT", but it has
    resulted in some suboptimal, if not awkward, solutions.
  </p>
  <h4>Example: "smart light bulb"</h4>
  <p>
    Smart light bulbs are a smart home consumer product that have become increasingly popular in
    recent years. They allow a user to wirelessly control a set of light bulbs using an
    Internet-connected device (e.g. a smartphone).

  </figure>
  <p>
    To enable this kind of remote control, smart light bulbs are configured to join a wireless LAN
    with Internet connectivity. Typically, a set of light bulbs are configured and controlled
    through a "hub" device; this allows the light bulbs to be controlled from a single access point,
    rather than having to configure/control each bulb individually. Hub devices are normally
    configured to manage only a specific set of nearby light bulbs and also must be able to access a
    cloud-based control service for receiving remote control commands.
  </p>
  <p>
    When remotely controlling the light bulbs, the controlling device connects and authenticates to
    the same control service, and then issues the desired commands (e.g. "ON", "OFF", "DIM(25%)",
    etc). Upon receiving these commands, the control service then relays the commands to the
    connected hub device, which in turn relays the command to each connected light bulb.
  </p>
  <p>
    An obvious problem in this setup is that a persistent Internet connection is required during
    times of operation in order to guarantee normal operation and quality of service. Furthermore,
    for most consumers, the ability to remotely operate a set of light bulbs from anywhere with an
    Internet connection is <em>not</em> as typical of a use case as local operation or the
    integration of the smart light bulbs with other nearby smart home appliances.
  </p>
  <h4>Example: "location-based directory"</h4>
  <p>
    Location-based directories allow a device to obtain a listing of nearby places using location
    services. A common example of this application is the use of GPS on a smartphone to discovery
    a listing of stores in a shopping mall.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/images/location-based-directory.png" alt="Location-based directory"/>
    <figcaption>

      listings of nearby places and things.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    To retrieve a list of nearby places, a smartphone uses passive GPS to locate the device's
    <em>global</em> coordinates. Once located, the GPS coordinates are then used to query against a
    cloud-based geo-search index, resulting in a list of nearby locations. Sometimes, as in the case
    of a well-defined point of interest such as a shopping mall, a process known as "reverse
    geocoding" can also be used to translate the GPS coordinates into an approximate address which
    is then used to look up a predefined directory listing for that address.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, in order to retrieve a location-based directory, a smartphone must ping an
    orbiting satellite in order to figure out which stores are in a mall right in front of you.
  </p>
  <p class="needs-work">
    It is for these reasons and plenty more that we must continue to innovate in IoT connectivity.

<section id="philosophy">
  <h3>Philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    To ensure a common understanding for the direction of the project, Rift is being developed with
    a few guiding principles:
  </p>
  <h4>Infrastructure-less</h4>
  <p>
    Rift employs existing wireless standards used for direct peer-to-peer connectivity. The result
    is an incredibly flexible network environment whose structure and services evolve with the needs
    of the participants. This is important for allowing software and hardware engineers to rapidly
    build and iterate on devices and applications without the major infrastructural and physical
    limitations of a network router, cellular tower, satellite, etc.
  </p>
  <h4>Simple and generic</h4>
  <p>
    The Rift architecture uses simple network primitives as the foundations of its application
    interface. These primitives are used solely for abstracting more complex and fine-grained
    network semantics into a network "language". This allows future wire[d|less] technologies to be
    ported and plugged in to existing applications. Furthermore, it is important to provide
    interoperability between Rift and non-Rift networks.
  </p>
  <h4>Portable</h4>
  <p>
    As is the nature of the IoT industry, Rift is intended to be run on a multitude of devices of
    different CPU architectures, power profiles, and in any environment. The network should strive
    to not be the limiting factor in IoT hardware or software design.
  </p>
  <h4>Good for humans, fair for business</h4>
  <p>
    The project itself aims to be inherently good for humans, and fair for businesses. We intend to
    keep it this way by keeping Rift implementations and designs open and community-driven.
    Furthermore, given the sensitive nature of the data transmitted through IoT technologies, we
    aim to keep privacy concerns (data collection, user identities, behavior tracking, etc) at the
    forefront of the discussion. This has been, and will continue to be an ongoing discussion.

<section id="scope">
  <h3>Scope</h3>
  <p>
    This documentation aims to provide a brief, but conceptually complete description of the Rift
    network stack.
  </p>
  <p>
    The information herein should be sufficient for any technical practitioner to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gain further insight into the unique connectivity problems of IoT networks</li>
    <li>Develop an understanding of how the Rift network stack addresses each of these problems</li>
    <li>Begin to integrate Rift concepts (and soon, code!) into new and existing IoT products</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    However, as it is impossible to develop a complete understanding of these technologies from
    static documentation, please see our <a href="/community.html">community documentation</a> for
    getting involved with any questions, comments, banter, and general discussions.
