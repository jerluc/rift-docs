    The Rift architecture, at a high level, can be described as a loose network of <mark>peers</mark>, who communicate over ephemeral network <mark>links</mark>, which are connected over varying network <mark>interfaces</mark> (typically, wireless interfaces). For example, imagine the scenario where a person is walking down the street bearing a Rift-compatible device:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/images/architecture.png" alt="architecture diagram"/>
    <figcaption>
      As the device passes by other Rift-compatible devices (stationary or not), they temporarily peer among themselves transparently, offering whatever services may be provided.
